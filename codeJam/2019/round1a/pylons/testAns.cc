#include <iostream>  // includes cin to read from stdin and cout to write to stdout
using namespace std;  // since cin and cout are both in namespace std, this saves some text

int main() {
  int t, r, c;
  cin >> t;  // read t. cin knows that t is an int, so it reads it as such.

  for (int i = 1; i <= t; ++i) {
    cin >> r >> c;  // read n and then m.
